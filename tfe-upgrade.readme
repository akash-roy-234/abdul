Terraform Enterprise (TFE) Production Upgrade Deployment Plan
________________________________________
Project: ECP Cloud Automation Tools (ECP CAT)
________________________________________
1. Purpose
This document provides a structured deployment plan for upgrading Terraform Enterprise (TFE) to version 202406-1 in the production environment. The upgrade is intended to improve functionality, address performance enhancements, and ensure support for our infrastructure-as-code (IaC) needs.
________________________________________
2. Scope
•	Environment: Production
•	Components Impacted: Terraform Enterprise (TFE), Ansible Tower
•	Key Stakeholders: ECP CAT Engineering Team, QA Team, End-Users
•	Dependencies: Ansible Tower, qTest for post-validation
________________________________________
3. Pre-Upgrade Preparation
1.	Documentation and Approval
o	Ensure all process documentation is updated and accessible on Confluence.
o	Secure approvals from key stakeholders for the deployment plan.
2.	Database Backup
o	Perform a complete backup of the TFE database to ensure data integrity.
o	Confirm the availability of the backup in a secure and accessible location to facilitate a rollback if necessary.
3.	Pre-Validation Checks
o	Run a series of pre-validation checks, including:
	Verifying system compatibility for TFE version 202406-1.
	Ensuring sufficient resource availability (CPU, RAM, Disk).
	Checking the database state, network connectivity, and other system dependencies.
4.	Communication and Scheduling
o	Schedule the upgrade during a designated maintenance window to minimize disruption.
o	Notify all affected teams and users of the scheduled maintenance and expected downtime.

4. Deployment Steps
1.	Update Ansible Playbook Configuration
o	Modify Ansible playbooks to reflect the TFE version 202406-1.
o	Test the updated playbooks in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility and accuracy.
2.	Execute Upgrade Using Ansible Template
o	Deploy the upgrade using a predefined Ansible Tower template to streamline the process.
o	The template will handle starting, stopping, and draining nodes in the TFE service as needed.
3.	Monitor Upgrade Process
o	Continuously monitor logs and progress throughout the upgrade process.
o	Be prepared to respond to any errors or unexpected behavior.
________________________________________
5. Post-Upgrade Validation
1.	Sanity and Validation Checks
o	Perform a series of post-upgrade validation tests to confirm that the TFE environment is functioning as expected.
o	Key validation steps include:
	Service Health Check: Verify that health check URLs return the expected responses.
	User Authentication: Ensure that users can authenticate and access TFE.
	Container and Database Connectivity: Confirm that the TFE container has connectivity and database objects are consistent.
2.	Functional Testing in qTest
o	Import test data into qTest and execute a set of predefined test cases, including:
	TFE application health check.
	Verification of email notifications.
	User login capabilities.
o	Document all test results and log evidence in qTest for compliance and record-keeping.

6. Post-Deployment Tasks
1.	Documentation Update
o	Update all relevant Confluence pages with the new TFE version details, including any functional changes introduced by the upgrade.
o	Document the successful completion of sanity checks and validation steps for audit purposes.
2.	Stakeholder Communication
o	Inform all stakeholders of the successful completion of the upgrade.
o	Provide an overview of any new features, changes, or known issues introduced by the upgrade.
3.	Monitoring and Support
o	Continue to monitor TFE performance and logs for any anomalies or performance issues post-upgrade.
o	Establish a support plan with clear escalation paths in case of any post-upgrade issues.

7. Risk Management and Mitigation
Risk	Impact	Mitigation Strategy
Data inconsistency post-upgrade	High	Comprehensive backup and post-upgrade validation steps
Service downtime during maintenance	Medium	Schedule during low-usage hours and communicate widely
Integration issues with external tools	Medium	Test all integrations thoroughly in pre-validation
Rollback complexity	Medium	Ensure rollback procedures are documented and tested
________________________________________
8. Rollback Plan
In case of a critical failure during or after the upgrade, follow these steps to roll back to the previous TFE version:
1.	Restore Database Backup
o	Use the pre-upgrade database backup to restore data integrity.
o	Confirm the success of the database restoration process.
2.	Revert Ansible Playbook Configuration
o	Restore the previous playbook configuration in Ansible Tower.
o	Run validation tests to ensure TFE operates as expected post-rollback.
3.	Notify Stakeholders
o	Inform all stakeholders of the rollback, including the reasons and the next steps.
